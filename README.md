# Haskell Solutions to the Cryptopals Crypto Challenges

The Cryptopals (n√©e Matasano) [Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com),
originally released in 2013,
are a series of coding challenges in cryptography.
They largely involve writing implementations of modern cryptosystems;
then, more importantly, breaking them in well-understood but
(at the time) rarely-implemented ways.
The topics include symmetric- and public-key cryptosystems,
digital signature schemes, cryptographic hashes,
random number generators, timing attacks, and elliptic curves.
All in all, the challenges are a lot of fun that ramp up from
'very easy' to 'somewhat challenging' to 'actually pretty difficult'.

This repository holds my Haskell solutions to all 66 challenges
from all eight problem sets. I've put it online because

1. There aren't many complete solutions; most repositories
   trail off after solving the first couple of problem sets,
   and even the more complete ones usually only have the first
   six problem sets (all that were originally published);
2. Very few solutions are online in Haskell.

My solutions are fairly heavily documented in
[Literate Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Literate_programming),
in Markdown to make them more easily readable from github.
I'm not claiming them as exemplar Haskell style,
just a possible, fairly idiomatic way to implement the challenges.
There is a test for every Challenge, in the `test/` directory,
which confirms that the cryptosystem or exploit works as expected.
Most of the Challenges have a module of their own, in the `src/` directory;
this directory also contains functions and data structures useful in
multiple Challenges, in their own modules.

## Problem Sets

There were originally six sets of eight problems each,
sent by email, one set at a time on demand.
Two more sets were eventually released,
for a total of eight sets and 64 problems.
By the time I did the challenges, several years after the original release,
the first seven sets were available online at [https://cryptopals.com].
Set 8 was not available until it was re-released in 2018,
with two bonus challenges, as part of a political fundraiser;
it's now online at [https://toadstyle.org/cryptopals/].

### Set One: Basics

1. **[Convert hex to base64](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/1)**:
   The [`Bytes`](src/Bytes.md) module introduces the `HasBytes` class,
   which describes anything that can be converted back and forth
   from a `ByteString`.
   The modules [`Bytes.Hex`](src/Bytes/Hex.md)
   and [`Bytes.Base64`](src/Bytes/Base64.md)
   contain instances for hex- and base64-encoded strings.

2. **[Fixed XOR](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/2)**:
   Adds the `xorb` function, which performs a byte-by-byte XOR
   of two `ByteString`s, to the [`Bytes`](src/Bytes.md) module.
